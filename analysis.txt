OVERVIEW
The purpose for this activity was to use the CSV file containing over 34,000 orgainzations funded by Alphabet soup and determine if their applicants would be suffieciently funded by the foundation.

Results
Dat Preprocessing
- the target for our model was the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column, which told us whether an applicant was was funded by the foundation. 
- the features used in this model were the "CLASSIFICATION" and the multiple "APPLICATION" columns. 
- we could potentially remoce the "INCOME_AMT" columns and the "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS" columns because they were never used in our prediction. 

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- The numbers I chose for the hidden nodes were in multiples of 7 (7, 14, 21) with 100 epochs. 
- No, I was not able to achieve the taget model performance. My accuracy only got to 73%. 
- I think we could increase the model performance by adding more epochs and more features.
